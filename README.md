our next generation solution for ambulance to avoid all traffic problems

## Our "The Next Generation Ambulance" was a very good project which came out as the result of 24 hours long Hackathon.
Initially all the electric poles on roads in the city will be attached with a pair of Siren and RFID Reader and very ambulance in the city will be provided with an RFID Tag on the roof of the ambulance.
In case of an emergency, the ambulance driver will select the desired route to an hospital.
As soon as he selects the route, the Sirens and RFID Readres for the next one km ahead of the ambulance will be activated and when ever the ambulance crosses a Siren which is ahead of the ambulance the respective RFID Reader near Siren will read the RFID Tag of that ambulance and switches of the Siren which is just crosses by the ambulance and switches on the Siren present after 1 km ahead of the ambulance for compensation of the deactivated Sire

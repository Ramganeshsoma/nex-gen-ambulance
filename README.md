# nex-gen-ambulance
our next generation solution for ambulance to avoid all traffic problems

## When the ambulance enters into a road, all the sirens located for the next 1km on the road will be activted and as the ambulance moves forward,the siren which is crossed by the ambulance will be switched Off and to compensate this effect, the next siren after the 1km range joins the network and gets switched On.
